## file-share
A simple webserver built in C++ using cpp-httplib to share files with others!

## Usage
Once you've got your webserver running, simply add files to the directory you've set in `STORAGE_DIRECTORY` and use `GET /<file_name>` to access any of them!

## Configuration
See the notes in [.env.example](https://github.com/M336G/file-share/blob/main/.env.example) to configure your webserver.
